Philippine defence chief urges ‘diplomatic protest’ after Chinese vessel sinks fishing boat in disputed waters

Fishing Boat Gem-Ver was left almost completely sunken after a Chinese vessel rammed its rear on June 9.

The sinking of a Filipino fishing boat by a suspected Chinese trawler in disputed waters was described by Beijing Thursday, June 13, as an ordinary maritime accident, after Manila accused the alleged Chinese crew of cowardice for fleeing the scene.
